## Project Overview 🎉
It is a project for registering notifications received by the dispatcher. I created it to make my work easier. Previously we used several openoffice, microsoft office programs. Often the report did not load (problems with saving correctly on different computers). The program saves the reports to a csv file on server.
You can change the design to your liking.
